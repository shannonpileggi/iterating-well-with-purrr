# Iterating Well With Purrr

An R-Ladies Rabat workshop.

Workshop materials have been adapted from the 2020 RStudio [What They Forgot To Teach You About R](https://rstats-wtf.github.io/wtf-2020-rsc/) Workshop.

Quarto slide styling was adapted from Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel's Stat 210 course ([website](https://sta210-s22.github.io/website/), [slide source](https://github.com/sta210-s22/website/tree/main/slides)).

# Abstract

In this workshop we discuss approaches to iteration in R.
We briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or `purrr::map_` (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.).
Then we explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes and explain how to extract elements from a list via the `purrr::map_` family.
